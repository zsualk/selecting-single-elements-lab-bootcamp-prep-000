## Selecting Elements Lab

### Introduction

Welcome to your first lab! Please read this entire readme. We'll try to only include information to help you. This way, we won't waste your time and will allow you to get to the coding as fast as possible.

We are going to continue with our search engine that pulls identifying information from Wikipedia. As you remember, Aardvark created a search engine such that when a user asked a question, the program would look to Wikipedia to pull related information about the question topic.


### Your task

In the last section, we pulled the header, the text from the first link and the `href` from the first link. In this section we are going to pull the same information, but from a different simplified Wikipedia page. Since this is a **lab** we are going to complete our final code in the JavaScript tab of the CodePen below. You will work in the Browser Console to discover what the final solution will be, but to complete the lab, you must put your completed code in the JavaScript Tab of the CodePen.

### The rules of the lab

OK, let's explain how to pass this lab, and stick this bad boy on your refrigerator for all the world to see.

</iframe>

Go ahead and select the JavaScript tab and you'll see some JavaScript code

```javascript
//Enter querySelector Code here
var header = "Adele Goldberg"
var linkText = "ENTER LINK TEXT CODE HERE"
var linkHref = "ENTER LINK HREF CODE HERE"


// NO NEED TO MODIFY BELOW HERE
console.log(`The header is: ${header}`)
console.log(`The first link text is: ${linkText}`)
console.log(`The first link href is: ${linkHref}`)
```

Let's take a look at what is going on.

The first three lines are _variable definitions_. Variables in JavaScript are just like you remember them in Algebra. They are simply names for some sort of data. The `=` sign assigns whatever is on the right side to be held inside of whatever is on the left side. With the default code the phrase `"ENTER HEADER CODE HERE"` is held inside of the `header` variable.

Open your Console by right clicking in the HTML preview (inside the red square)
of the CodePen. From the drop-down, select "Inspect."

You should see a console appear at the bottom or on the side (it doesn't
matter) of your browser that looks like this:

![Screenshot of Selecting the Console](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/fswb-assets/selecting-single-elements-lab/console_launched.png)

```
The header is: ENTER HEADER CODE HERE
The first link text is: ENTER LINK TEXT CODE HERE
The first link href is: ENTER LINK HREF CODE HERE
```

This is outputted by the `console.log` lines in the CodePen. The CodePen is outputting text to our Browser Console. Here is the code in the JavaScript tab of the CodePen that outputs to the Browser Console.

```
console.log(`The header is: ${header}`)
console.log(`The first link text is: ${linkText}`)
console.log(`The first link href is: ${linkHref}`)
```

`console.log` is a tool we use to output text to our console. Makes sense right? Above I told you that currently the `header` variable contains "ENTER HEADER CODE HERE". The first `console.log` looks like this:

```
console.log(`The header is: ${header}`)
```

This outputs `The header is: ENTER HEADER CODE HERE` to the Browser Console. Do you see what happened there? The `${header}` took the contents of `header` and made sure they were sent to the console.

Our task in this lab is to modify the three variables to be the correct `querySelector` to select the correct elements. You'll know you have selected the correct elements when your Browser Console says:

```
The header is: Adele Goldberg
The first link text is: computer scientist
The first link href is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist
```

### All Together Now

We are going to do the first one together, then you'll do the second two on your own. Here is your first task:

**Write the `querySelector` to grab the header, then use `innerHTML` to grab the contents of the header. You should put that code in the JavaScript tab of the CodePen where it says `"ENTER HEADER CODE HERE"`. Be sure to replace the quotes as well. If everything worked as planned your Browser Console will output `The header is: Adele Goldberg`**

The first variable asks for the `querySelector` line for the header. Using the same technique you learned in the previous lesson, inspect the element and find out the `id` attribute of the header. It should be `header`. Great, now in the Console (be sure to change the top dropdown to CodePen Preview) type `document.querySelector("#header")`. That should return the correct header. This time though I want just the words "Adele Goldberg". To get just the words in an `h1` tag we are going to use the `innerHTML` attribute.

 >There are a lot of attributes out there. Don't memorize them, just google around when you can't remember!

Back in the console type:


```javascript
document.querySelector("#header").innerHTML
```

That should return `"Adele Goldberg"`. Now, let's get it into our CodePen and make sure the Console is logging correctly.

Modify the first line of code to be:

```javascript
var header = document.querySelector("#header").innerHTML
```

Looking at the console, you should see the updated logging.

```
The header is: Adele Goldberg
The first link text is: ENTER LINK TEXT CODE HERE
The first link href is: ENTER LINK HREF CODE HERE
```

***NOTE***: When an error appears in the Chrome JavaScript console, you'll notice that the error message stays visible in the console even after you've modified the code in the CodePen. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can sometimes get a bit confusing if we're working on troubleshooting a new error and a bunch of old error messages are still cluttering up the console. Handily enough, Chrome provides a sweet built-in function, `clear()`, for clearing the JavaScript console. Simply enter `clear()` into the Chrome console and everything will disappear, replaced with a _`Console was cleared`_ message.

As programmers, we need to get familiar with breaking things. In fact, as
programmers, our code will spend most of it's life **not** working until
suddenly we get a complex set of interactions right so that it **is** working.
As a programmer thinking of yourself in "broken-land" and rejoicing only when
you hit "working-land" will help you and your ego. Think about it: if you're
coding while stressing about having moved from "working-land" to "broken-land"
you're going to experience stress. Start from the opposite assumption and
you're going to spend your days pleasantly surprised!

A key help in moving us from "broken-land" to "working-land" are errors that
appear in the Chrome console. Let's start with a common one.

What if we'd changed our code to be like this:

```javascript
var header = document.querySelector("#personName-header").innerHTML
console.log(header);
```

If we look in the HTML source, we'll see that there's no element with an
`id` of attribute "personName-header". So our call to `querySelector()` will
return **nothing**. So if you ask **nothing** for it's `innerHTML` attribute,
would you expect the browser to say a "broken" thing or a "working" thing?

Try changing your code and see:

```text
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'innerHTML' of null
    at VM43 pen.js:2
```

Well `null` is like **nothing**. So the browser is telling us it couldn't find
the `innerHMTL` property on **null**. Does that kind of seem like the error you
might have imagined up above?

Errors are our friends, here in "broken-land." Let them guide you.

### On Your Own

You've successfully completed the first question. Now, using what you've learned solve the next two problems:

 1. Using the `document.querySelector` and `text` attribute, set the `linkText` variable to equal the text of the first link, which is "computer scientist". This will be just like you did in the previous README. If done correctly, your console will output `the first link text is: computer scientist`.
 2. Using the `document.querySelector` and `href` attribute, set the `linkHref` variable to equal the `href` of the first link, which is `"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist"`. This will also be just like you did in the previous README. If done correctly, your console will output `The first link href is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist`.

Good luck!
